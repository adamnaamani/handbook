#### DPO (Direct Public Offering)
A DPO is similar to an initial public offering (IPO) in that securities, such as stock or debt, are sold to investors, but unlike an IPO, a company uses a DPO to raise capital directly and without a "firm underwriting" from an investment banking firm or broker-dealer.

#### HPI (Home Price Index)
A house price index measures the price changes of residential housing as a percentage change from some specific start date (which has HPI of 100). Methodologies commonly used to calculate a HPI are the hedonic regression (HR), simple moving average (SMA) and repeat-sales regression (RSR).

#### IPO (Initial Public Offering)
In an IPO, new shares of the company are created, and are underwritten by an intermediary. The underwriter works closely with the company throughout the IPO process, including deciding the initial offer price of the shares, helping with regulatory requirements, buying the available shares from the company and then selling them to investors via their distribution networks.

#### Latency

#### PREC (Personal Real Estate Corporation)
Personal real estate corporations allow real estate licensees to access the business advantages of incorporation, including better planning of income and tax streams.

#### SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)  
These algorithms are designed to be one-way functions, meaning that once they’re transformed into their respective hash values, it’s virtually impossible to transform them back into the original data.

#### UTM (Urchin Tracking Module)  
Parameters are five variants of URL parameters used by marketers to track the effectiveness of online marketing campaigns across traffic sources and publishing media.  
| Parameter    | Purpose                                                                                                                   |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| utm_source   | Identifies which site sent the traffic, and is a required parameter.                                                      |
| utm_medium   | Identifies what type of link was used, such as cost per click or email.                                                   |

| utm_content  | Identifies what specifically was clicked to bring the user to the site, such as a banner ad or a text link (A/B testing). |

#### Web Sockets
Rather than delivering data in batches through repeated requests by a client app, as might be expected from a REST API, a single connection is opened between an app and the API, with new results being sent through that connection whenever new matches occur. This results in a long-lived, low-latency delivery mechanism that can support very high throughput.
