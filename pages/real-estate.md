> “In 1960, a portion of the Musqueam reserve was surrendered by Musqueam Indian Band (MIB) in trust to the federal Crown for the purpose of leasing. The Crown entered into a Master Agreement whereby a development company serviced the lands and subdivided the property into lots. The federal Crown then granted leases for the lots to the development company who, in turn, assigned the leases to other parties. The leases had a 99-year term running from 1965 and provided for periodic rent reviews. The first rent review was in 1995. The object of the rent review was to set ‘fair rent’ based on 6% of the ‘current land value’ as if, among other things, the land was unimproved.”

> “Gonthier J. and his concurring colleagues held that the “fee simple off-reserve value cannot simply be transposed to the Musqueam land …”[iii]
On the evidence appearing in the record, Gonthier J. and his concurring colleagues accepted that a 50% discount between off-reserve lands and reserve lands was appropriate but added “… it will be a question of fact what, if any, discount should be applied.”[iv]

> “Nevertheless, based upon the reasoning of Gonthier J. and his concurring colleagues in Glass and now the Federal Court decision in Hodgson, it appears that determination of ‘current land value’ for on-reserve land will necessarily involve the appraiser in assessing the legal restrictions and market conditions that may impact the fee simple interest in such lands, but that to do so might be a derivative exercise requiring some creativity in approach to find appropriate proxies for value when there is little or no likelihood that reserve land will ever be available in a freehold state.”
