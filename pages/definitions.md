#### ACH (Automated Clearing House)
A network that coordinates electronic payments and automated money transfers. ACH is a way to move money between banks without using paper checks, wire transfers, credit card networks, or cash.

#### Activation Function
In artificial neural networks, the activation function of a node defines the output of that node given an input or set of inputs.

#### Ad hoc
Ad hoc is a Latin phrase meaning literally "to this". In English, it generally signifies a solution designed for a specific problem or task, non-generalizable, and not intended to be able to be adapted to other purposes.

#### Atomic
Atomicity is a guarantee of isolation from concurrent processes. Additionally, atomic operations commonly have a succeed-or-fail definition — they either successfully change the state of the system, or have no apparent effect.

#### Burndown Chart
A burn down chart is a graphical representation of work left to do versus time. The outstanding work is often on the vertical axis, with time along the horizontal. Burn down charts are a run chart of outstanding work. It is useful for predicting when all of the work will be completed.

#### Cartesian Product
The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.

#### Circular Dependency
A relation between two or more modules which either directly or indirectly depend on each other to function properly.

#### CMHC (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation)
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation is a Crown Corporation of the Government of Canada. Its superseding agency was established after World War II, to help returning war veterans find housing. It has since expanded its mandate to assist housing for all Canadians.

#### Credit Note
Also known as credit memo. Issued to indicate a return of funds in the event of an invoice error, incorrect or damaged products, purchase cancellation, or otherwise specified circumstance.

#### DPO (Direct Public Offering)
A DPO is similar to an initial public offering (IPO) in that securities, such as stock or debt, are sold to investors, but unlike an IPO, a company uses a DPO to raise capital directly and without a "firm underwriting" from an investment banking firm or broker-dealer.

#### Epochs
An **epoch** is a term used in machine learning and indicates the number of passes through the entire training dataset the machine learning algorithm has completed.

#### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR aims primarily to give control to individuals over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU. Superseding the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, the regulation contains provisions and requirements related to the processing of personal data of individuals (formally called data subjects in the GDPR) who reside in the EEA, and applies to any enterprise—regardless of its location and the data subjects' citizenship or residence—that is processing the personal information of data subjects inside the EEA.

#### HPI (Home Price Index)
A house price index measures the price changes of residential housing as a percentage change from some specific start date (which has HPI of 100). Methodologies commonly used to calculate a HPI are the hedonic regression (HR), simple moving average (SMA) and repeat-sales regression (RSR).

#### IPO (Initial Public Offering)
In an IPO, new shares of the company are created, and are underwritten by an intermediary. The underwriter works closely with the company throughout the IPO process, including deciding the initial offer price of the shares, helping with regulatory requirements, buying the available shares from the company and then selling them to investors via their distribution networks.

#### Latency
The delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction for its transfer.

#### MdAPE
Calculates the median absolute percentage error (MdAPE) between the forecast and the eventual outcomes.

#### Neural Network
Artificial neural networks (ANN) or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems "learn" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with task-specific rules. For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as "cat" or "no cat" and using the results to identify cats in other images. They do this without any prior knowledge of cats, for example, that they have fur, tails, whiskers and cat-like faces. Instead, they automatically generate identifying characteristics from the examples that they process.

An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal to other neurons. An artificial neuron that receives a signal then processes it and can signal neurons connected to it.

#### Op-ed
Short for "opposite the editorial page", is a written prose piece typically published by a newspaper or magazine which expresses the opinion of an author usually not affiliated with the publication's editorial board. Op-eds are different from both editorials and letters to the editor.

#### PREC (Personal Real Estate Corporation)
Personal real estate corporations allow real estate licensees to access the business advantages of incorporation, including better planning of income and tax streams.

#### Semver (Semantic Versioning)
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes.
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner.
3. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

#### SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)  
These algorithms are designed to be one-way functions, meaning that once they’re transformed into their respective hash values, it’s virtually impossible to transform them back into the original data.

#### Smoke testing
In computer programming and software testing, smoke testing (also confidence testing, sanity testing, build verification test and build acceptance test) is preliminary testing to reveal simple failures severe enough to, for example, reject a prospective software release.

#### Stochastic Gradient Descent
stochastic | stəˈkastɪk |  
adjective _technical_  
Having a random probability distribution or pattern that may be analysed statistically but may not be predicted precisely.

An iterative method for optimizing an objective function with suitable smoothness properties (e.g. differentiable or subdifferentiable). It can be regarded as a stochastic approximation of gradient descent optimization, since it replaces the actual gradient (calculated from the entire data set) by an estimate thereof (calculated from a randomly selected subset of the data). Especially in big data applications this reduces the computational burden, achieving faster iterations in trade for a slightly lower convergence rate.

#### Thrashing
In computer science, thrashing occurs when a computer's virtual memory resources are overused, leading to a constant state of paging and page faults, inhibiting most application-level processing. This causes the performance of the computer to degrade or collapse. The situation can continue indefinitely until either the user closes some running applications or the active processes free up additional virtual memory resources.

#### UTM (Urchin Tracking Module)  
Parameters are five variants of URL parameters used by marketers to track the effectiveness of online marketing campaigns across traffic sources and publishing media.  
| Parameter    | Purpose                                                                                                                   |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| utm_source   | Identifies which site sent the traffic, and is a required parameter.                                                      |
| utm_medium   | Identifies what type of link was used, such as cost per click or email.                                                   |
| utm_campaign | Identifies a specific product promotion or strategic campaign.                                                            |
| utm_term     | Identifies search terms.                                                                                                  |
| utm_content  | Identifies what specifically was clicked to bring the user to the site, such as a banner ad or a text link (A/B testing). |

#### Web Sockets
Rather than delivering data in batches through repeated requests by a client app, as might be expected from a REST API, a single connection is opened between an app and the API, with new results being sent through that connection whenever new matches occur. This results in a long-lived, low-latency delivery mechanism that can support very high throughput.
